# Data Discription
***
In this article, we will take the Manhattan area as an example to discuss the location of restaurants. Because the location of restaurants is generally determined by population and the density of restaurants. A sufficient population means a huge customer flow, and the right restaurant density will form a certain scale effect, helping new restaurants to better survive the first three years when they are most likely to fail. The data in this article comes from the following two websites and the API provided by FourSquare, which provide geographic location data of New York towns, population data of New York districts, and restaurant distribution data of Manhattan.
